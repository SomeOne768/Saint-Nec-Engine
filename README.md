# Saint-Nec Engine

Saint-Nec Engine is 3rd year engineering school project created by Abdeljalil Zoghlami and Antonin Devidal starting on october 8th and ending on march 17th.

This 240h project aim to create a physic and graphic engine using C++ and OpenGL on Visual Studio.

## Technologies

- C++ 17
- OpenGL 4.1
- CMake (tested on Windows and Linux)
- Tracy profiler (v0.10.0)

In this project, we are reinventing the wheel because we canâ€™t create better things without understanding the base of what we are working on.

## [Documentation](https://antonindevidal.github.io/Saint-Nec-Engine-Documentation)

You can find Doxygen documentation enhanced with [Doxygen Theme - Flat Design](https://github.com/kcwongjoe/doxygen_theme_flat_design).

## Objectives

### Physics

- [ ]  Basic objects collisions ( spheres, cubes)
- [ ]  Complex objects collisions ( terrain)

### Graphics

- [ ]  Terrain generation
- [ ]  Grass simulation
- [ ]  Water simulation

This tasks will use various implementation techniques such as particles, complex shaders, lighting, level of detail and multi-threading.

## Utilization

### On Linux

- create the folder build: <span style="color:orange">Saint-Nec-Engine/Saint-Nec-Engine/build</span>
- move in the build folder
- type cmake ..
- The game executable is in <span style="color:orange">build/Saint-Nec-Engine</span>

### Commandes

You can move the camera with the touch:
- Z : above
- S : behind
- Q : left
- D : right
- Shift : up
- Space : down
- F1 : unlock mouse selector
- F2 : Wireframe mode
